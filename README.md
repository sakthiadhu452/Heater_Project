Ceramic heater uses nichrome coil when we give 230v supply it will start to generate heat.

## I have creaded a website there where it contains login credentials then it will jump to dashboard where i have buttons and display of temperature nextly by clicking details redirected to details page where we can see list of when the heater turned on and off by choosing a date between.

1.Thermocouple (type-K) <br>

2.Max6675 module  <br>

3.5v relay
